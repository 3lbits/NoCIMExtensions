Instead it is captured by the Measurement - Terminal association that is used to define the sensing location in the network topology.

Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N."
