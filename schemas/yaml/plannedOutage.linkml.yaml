The enumeration, by itself, does not describe how the phases are connected together or connected to ground.  Ground is not explicitly denoted as a phase.Residential and small commercial loads are often served from single-phase, or split-phase, secondary circuits. For the example of s12N, phases 1 and 2 refer to hot wires that are 180 degrees out of phase, while N refers to the neutral wire. Through single-phase transformer connections, these secondary circuits may be served from one or two of the primary phases A, B, and C. For three-phase loads, use the A, B, C phase codes instead of s12N.The integer values are from IEC 61968-9 to support revenue metering applications."
