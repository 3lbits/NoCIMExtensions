# ControlArea

_A control area is a grouping of generating units and/or loads and a cutset of tie lines (as terminals) which may be used for a variety of purposes including automatic generation control, power flow solution area interchange control specification, and input to load forecasting. All generation and load within the area defined by the terminals on the border are considered in the area interchange control. Note that any number of overlapping control area specifications can be superimposed on the physical model. The following general principles apply to ControlArea:1.  The control area orientation for net interchange is positive for an import, negative for an export.2.  The control area net interchange is determined by summing flows in Terminals. The Terminals are identified by creating a set of TieFlow objects associated with a ControlArea object. Each TieFlow object identifies one Terminal.3.  In a single network model, a tie between two control areas must be modelled in both control area specifications, such that the two representations of the tie flow sum to zero.4.  The normal orientation of Terminal flow is positive for flow into the conducting equipment that owns the Terminal. (i.e. flow from a bus into a device is positive.) However, the orientation of each flow in the control area specification must align with the control area convention, i.e. import is positive. If the orientation of the Terminal flow referenced by a TieFlow is positive into the control area, then this is confirmed by setting TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag TRUE. If not, the orientation must be reversed by setting the TieFlow.positiveFlowIn flag FALSE._

| mRID | [cim:IdentifiedObject.mRID](https://cim.ucaiug.io/ns#IdentifiedObject.mRID) | 0..1 string | Master resource identifier issued by a model authority. The mRID is unique within an exchange context. Global uniqueness is easily achieved by using a UUID, as specified in RFC 4122, for the mRID. The use of UUID is strongly recommended.For CIMXML data files in RDF syntax conforming to IEC 61970-552, the mRID is mapped to rdf:ID or rdf:about attributes that identify CIM object elements. | IdentifiedObject |
| description | [cim:IdentifiedObject.description](https://cim.ucaiug.io/ns#IdentifiedObject.description) | 0..1 string | The description is a free human readable text describing or naming the object. It may be non unique and may not correlate to a naming hierarchy. | IdentifiedObject |
| name | [cim:IdentifiedObject.name](https://cim.ucaiug.io/ns#IdentifiedObject.name) | 0..1 string | The name is any free human readable and possibly non unique text naming the object. | IdentifiedObject |
