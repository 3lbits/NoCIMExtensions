# Profiles in CIM for Norway

Common Information Model (CIM) profiles are standardized data models that define the structure and semantics of data exchanged between systems in the energy domain. These profiles ensure interoperability and consistency by providing a common framework for representing information. Each profile is tailored to specific use cases or domains, such as aviation obstacles or energy applications, facilitating seamless integration and communication across different systems and organizations.
