| [GeometryObject](GeometryObject.md) | An object that represents a jsonld compound to support value, type and language. |
| [IdentifiedObject](IdentifiedObject.md) | This is a root class to provide common identification for all classes needing identification and naming attributes. |
| [LanguageObject](LanguageObject.md) | An object that represents a jsonld compound to support value, type and language. |
| [PowerSystemResource](PowerSystemResource.md) | A power system resource (PSR) can be an item of equipment such as a switch, an equipment container containing many individual items of equipment such as a substation, or an organisational entity such as sub-control area. Power system resources can have measurements associated. |
| [SpatialObject](SpatialObject.md) | A spatial object is a physical object that has a location in space. It may have a geometric representation to describe its shape and position. |
